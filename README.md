# nosql-challenge

Challenge 12 This project uses MongoDB to manage data for UK restaurants, with a focus on sanitation scores and other restaurant features. It uses pymongo to connect to the MongoDB server and runs queries like filtering establishments by cleanliness score, Local Authority, and RatingValue. The findings are obtained and processed using Python and Pandas to create DataFrames for analysis. Aggregation pipelines can also be used to group, sort, and analyze data depending on specified criteria, such as hygiene scores and location.
